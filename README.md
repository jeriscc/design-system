# design-system

A react component library for my personal website â€“ my project for my CS189 course.

Inspired by the [HackClub Design System][hackclub] and [Princeline Design System][priceline].

TODO:
- I don't understand why the global css is injected when everything is not wrapped in ThemeProvider.
- Write out all compoenents
- Test out functionality of theme provider by exporting basic theme colors.

LONGTERM GOALS:
- Building out important components
- Change storybook into custom next.js documentation site like priceline.
- Writing tests (enzyme)
