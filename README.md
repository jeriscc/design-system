# design-system

A react component library for my personal website – my project for my CS189 course.

Inspired by the [HackClub’s design system][hackclub].

TODO:
- I don't understand why the global css is injected when everything is not wrapped in ThemeProvider.
- Build out functional theme provider which can be used in website. [Styled-system](https://jxnblk.com/styled-system/getting-started)
- Test out functionality of theme provider by exporting basic theme colors.

LONGTERM GOALS:
- Building out important components
- Visualizing components with storybook
- Writing tests (enzyme)
