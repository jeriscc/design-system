# design-system

A react component library for my personal website â€“ my project for my CS189 course.

Inspired by the [HackClub Design System][hackclub] and [Princeline Design System][priceline].

TODO:
- Complete the `Text` and `Link` components (and their stories).
- Finishing learning CSS-Grid and Flexbox and write custom components for them.
- Finish learning about the differences between `rem`, `em`, and `px` and change the default spacing values into deliberate choices.
- Decompose the globally injected styles (copied from Gatsby starter) into separate components.
- Publish this design-system to npm as a beta version to decouple my website from this repository

LONGTERM GOALS:
- Finish all the neccessary components and their stories.
- Make the design system my own.
- Create test coverage scripts and write tests (via enzyme) to 100% coverage.
- Rewrite the documentation from `storybook` into an aesthetically pleasing and accessible custom documentation site utilizing `Next.js` and [mdx-docs][mdx] like [Princeline Design System][priceline]. Serve that site via Github pages.
- After publishing, decomposing the package into separately installable packages via Lerna.js.
- Write a blog post about my process and publish it.
